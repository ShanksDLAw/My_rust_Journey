    //Basic Variable Declaration
    // All variables are immutable by default and to make it mutable use
    //Use the key word 'mut'
    // to declare a variable use the keyword 'let'
    let y = 60;
    let x = 45;
    let sum = y + x;

    // Data Types
    //In Rust the data types are denoted (numerical data types) as either 
    //either an unsigned integer (u) or signed integter
    //examples u32 - unsigned integer of size 32 bits
    // examples i32 - signed integer of size 32 bit
    // For Float can be f32 or f64
